[1478. 签到与签出 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1480/)

At the beginning of every day, the first person who signs in the computer room will unlock the door, and the last one who signs out will lock the door. Given the records of signing in's and out's, you are supposed to find the ones who have unlocked and locked the door on that day.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the records for one day. The case starts with a positive integer *M*, which is the total number of records, followed by *M* lines, each in the format:

```
ID_number Sign_in_time Sign_out_time
```

where times are given in the format `HH:MM:SS`, and `ID_number` is a string with no more than 15 characters.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the ID numbers of the persons who have unlocked and locked the door on that day. The two ID numbers must be separated by one space.

Note: It is guaranteed that the records are consistent. That is, the sign in time must be earlier than the sign out time for each person, and there are no two persons sign in or out at the same moment.

### Sample Input:

```in

[1519. 密码 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1521/)

To prepare for PAT, the judge sometimes has to generate random passwords for the users. The problem is that there are always some confusing passwords since it is hard to distinguish `1` (one) from `l` (`L` in lowercase), or `0` (zero) from `O` (`o` in uppercase). One solution is to replace `1` (one) by `@`, `0` (zero) by `%`, `l` by `L`, and `O` by `o`. Now it is your job to write a program to check the accounts generated by the judge, and to help the juge modify the confusing passwords.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a positive integer *N* (≤1000), followed by *N* lines of accounts. Each account consists of a user name and a password, both are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, first print the number *M* of accounts that have been modified, then print in the following *M* lines the modified accounts info, that is, the user names and the corresponding modified passwords. The accounts must be printed in the same order as they are read in. If no account is modified, print in one line `There are N accounts and no account is modified` where `N` is the total number of accounts. However, if `N` is one, you must print `There is 1 account and no account is modified` instead.

### Sample Input 1:

[1520. 男孩 vs 女孩 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1522/)

This time you are asked to tell the difference between the lowest grade of all the male students and the highest grade of all the female students.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains a positive integer *N*, followed by *N* lines of student information. Each line contains a student's `name`, `gender`, `ID` and `grade`, separated by a space, where `name` and `ID` are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space, `gender` is either `F` (female) or `M` (male), and `grade` is an integer between 0 and 100. It is guaranteed that all the grades are distinct.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in 3 lines. The first line gives the name and ID of the female student with the highest grade, and the second line gives that of the male student with the lowest grade. The third line gives the difference *g**r**a**d**e**F*−*g**r**a**d**e**M*. If one such kind of student is missing, output `Absent` in the corresponding line, and output `NA` in the third line instead.

### Sample Input 1:

[1534. 字符串减法 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1536/)

Given two strings *S*1 and *S*2, *S*=*S*1−*S*2 is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in *S*2 from *S*1. Your task is simply to calculate *S*1−*S*2 for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it **fast**.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives *S*1 and *S*2, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than 104. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print *S*1−*S*2 in one line.

[1557. 说话方式 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1559/)

People often have a preference among synonyms of the same word. For example, some may prefer "the police", while others may prefer "the cops". Analyzing such patterns can help to narrow down a speaker's identity, which is useful when validating, for example, whether it's still the same person behind an online avatar.

Now given a paragraph of text sampled from someone's speech, can you find the person's most commonly used word?

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line of text no more than 1048576 characters in length, terminated by a carriage return `\n`. The input contains at least one alphanumerical character, i.e., one character from the set [`0-9 A-Z a-z`].

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the most commonly occurring word in the input text, followed by a space and the number of times it has occurred in the input. If there are more than one such words, print the lexicographically smallest one. The word should be printed in all lower case. Here a "word" is defined as a continuous sequence of alphanumerical characters separated by non-alphanumerical characters or the line beginning/end.

Note that words are case **insensitive**.

### Sample Input:

```in
Can1: "Can a can can a can?  It can!"

[1547. 约会 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1549/)

Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: `Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm`. It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time `Thursday 14:04` -- since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter `D`, representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter `E`, representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from `A` to `N`, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is `s` at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format `DAY HH:MM`, where `DAY` is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week -- that is, `MON` for Monday, `TUE` for Tuesday, `WED` for Wednesday, `THU` for Thursday, `FRI` for Friday, `SAT` for Saturday, and `SUN` for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.

[1493. 电话账单 - AcWing题库](https://www.acwing.com/problem/content/1495/)

A long-distance telephone company charges its customers by the following rules:

Making a long-distance call costs a certain amount per minute, depending on the time of day when the call is made. When a customer starts connecting a long-distance call, the time will be recorded, and so will be the time when the customer hangs up the phone. Every calendar month, a bill is sent to the customer for each minute called (at a rate determined by the time of day). Your job is to prepare the bills for each month, given a set of phone call records.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case has two parts: the rate structure, and the phone call records.

The rate structure consists of a line with 24 non-negative integers denoting the toll (cents/minute) from 00:00 - 01:00, the toll from 01:00 - 02:00, and so on for each hour in the day.

The next line contains a positive number *N* (≤1000), followed by *N* lines of records. Each phone call record consists of the name of the customer (string of up to 20 characters without space), the time and date (`MM:dd:HH:mm`), and the word `on-line` or `off-line`.

For each test case, all dates will be within a single month. Each `on-line` record is paired with the chronologically next record for the same customer provided it is an `off-line` record. Any `on-line` records that are not paired with an `off-line` record are ignored, as are `off-line` records not paired with an `on-line` record. It is guaranteed that at least one call is well paired in the input. You may assume that no two records for the same customer have the same time. Times are recorded using a 24-hour clock.

### Output Specification:

For each test case, you must print a phone bill for each customer.

Bills must be printed in alphabetical order of customers' names. For each customer, first print in a line the name of the customer and the month of the bill in the format shown by the sample. Then for each time period of a call, print in one line the beginning and ending time and date (`dd:HH:mm`), the lasting time (in minute) and the charge of the call. The calls must be listed in chronological order. Finally, print the total charge for the month in the format shown by the sample.

### Sample Input:

```in
